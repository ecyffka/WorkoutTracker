# Workout Tracker!

## (Track both strength workouts and runs.)

- This is an application for people who exercise. **(Meaning me. It's for me.)**
- It will allow users to track both runs (date, distance, route, notes) and 
strength workouts (name, date, rounds, notes, and a list of exercises.\
** rounds: rounds through a circuit. I like circuits, therefore everyone
likes circuits.\
** exerise: an exercise consists of a name and any equipment needed
- This project is of interest to me because I exercise just about every day. I tend to 
 just scribble my workouts down on scraps of paper, which later vanish into the abyss. It would be nice to 
have an application to help track my workouts to help me remember what I did in the past, what worked, and what didn't.
The run log aspect is more just for record keeping, and, in a later phase of this project, 
to be able to see stats for the week/month/year. I'm a pretty casual runner (ie. don't care about
time, pace, splits, etc.), but tracking things gives me a little dopamine kick, so that's a nice aspect as well.
